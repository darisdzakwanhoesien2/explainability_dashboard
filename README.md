Yes — this is very doable, and it fits **perfectly** with your Streamlit-heavy workflow.

Below is a **clean, production-ready Streamlit app** that:

✅ Uploads a `.ipynb` file
✅ Creates a **dedicated project folder**
✅ Saves the original notebook
✅ Converts it to `.py`
✅ Allows downloading the generated `.py`
✅ Scales cleanly for `project_1/`, `project_2/`, …

It uses **nbformat + nbconvert**, which is the correct and robust way.

## 📁 Folder Structure (Auto-created)

After upload, your app will generate:

```text
projects/
├── project_1/
│   ├── project_1.ipynb
│   └── project_1.py
├── project_2/
│   ├── project_2.ipynb
│   └── project_2.py
```

---

## 🔧 Requirements

Make sure these are installed:

```bash
pip install streamlit nbformat nbconvert
```

---

## 🧠 Streamlit App — `app.py`

```python

```

---

## ✨ What This Does Well (Architecturally)

✔ Uses **nbconvert (AST-safe)** — not regex hacks
✔ Deterministic project naming
✔ Clean file system layout
✔ Preview + download
✔ Easily extensible

---

## 🚀 Easy Extensions (Tell me if you want these)

You can add:

1. **Streamlit-ready conversion**

   * Wrap code into `st.write()` / `st.pyplot()` blocks
2. **Metadata stripping**

   * Remove execution counts, outputs
3. **Cell annotations**

   ```python
   # ===== Cell 3 =====
   ```
4. **Batch upload**
5. **Git integration**
6. **Diagram/code explainability pipeline**
   (very aligned with your recent explainability tooling)

---

If you want, next we can:

* Convert `.ipynb → Streamlit app automatically`
* Add **LLM-based code explanation**
* Integrate this into your existing multi-page Streamlit system

Just say the word 👍
